#This is the readme for my practice setup of Ansible. 
I attempt to comment all of my playbooks to the best of my knowledge as I look at others' code and learn from mentors at work.
The main goal of this will be learning Ansible and/or automation in general for provisioning machines. There WILL be broken playbooks.
This will be a test repo for an Ansible setup as I learn it- I will have a different repo for automation I'll be working on towards a Factorio server.
